### Compiling:

For Unix based systems (MacOS & Linux):
- Download repositiory
- In the project root directory, run `./gradlew run`

For Windows:
- Download repositiory
- In the project root directory, run `.\gradlew.bat run`

### Code Structure:
The main function in the `App` class is run at the start of the program. 
This creates a new `Game` which calls its `init()` and `run()` methods.
